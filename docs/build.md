# Neat is a clone of git


## Stage 1 : neat init

Git is Version control. It tracks changes overtime. 
Everything about git is stored in .git which is a hidden file.
Create a .git folder with refs and objects as sub-folders and a HEAD file.
If you know linked list we name the main point as head. 
This HEAD is similar it should point to something for now lets say HEAD points to "ref: refs/heads/main".
